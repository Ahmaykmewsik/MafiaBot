## Mafia Bot

Hey look it's a mafia bot.

Ahmaykmewsik made it for the HQC Discord Mafia group in 2018.

Made with discord.js and enmap

Won't work without a config.json file with the token and prefix info 
(not uploaded to github cause otherwise you could hack my bot).

**Functionalities:**
1. Assist mafia players in voting (biggest thing)
2. Posting a log of the current vote count
3. Assist in anonymous communication between players (jailor and jailkeeper)
4. Create a "secret vault" where players can post secrets during the game.
5. Track player activity in the main voting channel organized by phase number.



**-------TO DO-------**

-Cut off posting permissions for hammered player when majority is reached (+ability to turn this on and off by GM)

-Locally save and load image avatars in voting logs cuz discord sure doesn't, they break after a player changes their pfp.

-Fix rare voting display bug, something to do with unvoting I think?

-Make multi guild friendly (requires big overhaul!)

-Custom voting manupulation?

-Additional game functionalities as needed



**CHANGELOG:**
V1.0 - First public release, guess we're calling this version 1.0 (Even though I've been working on this for a while now.)
